# Geometry 2D Tiny Helpers

This library is a set of static methods to perform basic 2D geometry computations using points, lines and segments. They are useful for user interface programming, selection of graphics elements, data processing and computations.

- Distances : points, point / segment, point / line.
- Intersection : lines, segments.
- Perpendicular segments.
- Projection of a point on a line.
- Angles : of a segment, between two segments, half or complete clock.
- Segment interpolation.
- Point rotation around a point.
- Linear regression : slope, intercept and r computation.
- B-Spline interpolation.

## Point distance

Basic point to point disance :
